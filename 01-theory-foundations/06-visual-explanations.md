*   **Why Watch:** A clear, concise, and visually rich walkthrough of the Transformer architecture and how self-attention is calculated. Perfect after reading the paper.

### 3. The Best Overall "How LLMs Work" Video
*   **What:** How Large Language Models Work
*   **By:** IBM Technology
*   **Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M)
*   **Why Watch:** Incredible animations that show the flow of data through an LLM—from tokenization to embedding to attention and final output. It ties all the concepts together beautifully.

### 4. Deep Dive into Attention with Animations
*   **What:** Illustrated: Self-Attention
*   **By:** Udacity
*   **Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJQG4DuHT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJQG4DuHT0)
*   **Why Watch:** Breaks down the Query, Key, and Value concept with smooth animations, showing exactly how the attention scores are calculated and used.

## 🌐 Interactive Articles & Tools

### 1. The Transformer Animation
*   **What:** The Illustrated Transformer
*   **By:** Jay Alammar
*   **Link:** [https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
*   **Why Read:** This is a legendary blog post. It uses step-by-step diagrams to explain the Transformer's workflow. It is the perfect companion to the "Attention is All You Need" paper.

### 2. Play with Word Embeddings
*   **What:** TensorFlow Embedding Projector
*   **By:** TensorFlow
*   **Link:** [https://projector.tensorflow.org/](https://projector.tensorflow.org/)
*   **Why Use:** An interactive tool to visualize high-dimensional word embeddings in 2D or 3D. You can search for words like "king," "queen," "man," "woman" and see their spatial relationships for yourself.

### 3. See Tokenization Happen in Real-Time
*   **What:** OpenAI Tokenizer
*   **By:** OpenAI
*   **Link:** [https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)
*   **Why Use:** Type in any text and see exactly how GPT models break it down into tokens. This makes the abstract concept of tokenization concrete.

### 4. Understand Positional Encoding
*   **What:** Transformer Architecture: The Positional Encoding
*   **By:** Amirhossein Kazemnejad
*   **Link:** [https://kazemnejad.com/blog/transformer_architecture_positional_encoding/](https://kazemnejad.com/blog/transformer_architecture_positional_encoding/)
*   **Why Read:** A deep dive into the math and intuition behind sinusoidal positional encodings, with great graphs to show how they work.

## 📚 Recommended Playlists for Deeper Dives

*   **DeepLearning.AI's Short Courses:** Their [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DeepLearningAI) has excellent short courses on NLP. Look for courses on "Attention Mechanisms" and "Transformer Models."
*   **Stanford CS25: Transformers United:** This seminar series [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNiJRchCzutFw5ItR_Z27CM) features talks from creators of major Transformer models. It's advanced but incredibly insightful.
