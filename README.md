A structured learning path and project portfolio for software engineers to master **Large Language Models**. This repository moves beyond theory, focusing on the practical application of LLMs through prompt engineering, API integration, and building scalable applications.

> **💡 For Developers, By a Developer:** This isn't just a list of concepts. It's a hands-on curriculum designed to take you from foundational understanding to building production-ready LLM applications.

## 📖 Overview

The field of Large Language Models is moving fast. This repository provides a structured path to not just keep up, but to become proficient. It's organized into a **28-step curriculum** that balances deep theoretical understanding with immediate, practical application.

Whether you're building AI-powered features into your product, automating workflows, or launching a new AI-based service, this guide will help you develop the necessary skills.

## 🧭 The 28-Day Learning Path

The curriculum is divided into six logical parts:

| Part | Focus Area | What You'll Achieve |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. Theory Foundations** | Core Concepts | Understand how LLMs work under the hood |
| **2. Prompt Engineering** | Communication | Master the art of guiding LLMs to desired outputs |
| **3. Practical Applications** | API Integration | Build functional applications using various LLM APIs |
| **4. Advanced Topics** | Production Systems | Implement RAG, work with vector DBs, and build agents |
| **5. Build Projects** | Portfolio Development | Create showcase projects for your portfolio |
| **6. Next Steps** | Career Planning | Define your specialization and next learning goals |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For the Structured Learner (Recommended)
1. **Start with Theory**: Begin with `01-theory-foundations/README.md`
2. **Follow the Path**: Progress through each section in order
3. **Build as You Learn**: Implement projects in `05-build-projects/` as you acquire relevant skills
4. **Assess Your Knowledge**: Use the quizzes to validate your understanding

### For the Project-Focused Learner
1. **Skim the Theory**: Review `01-theory-foundations/04-key-terminologies.md`
2. **Master Prompting**: Study `02-prompt-engineering/` thoroughly
3. **Pick a Project**: Choose a project from `05-build-projects/project-ideas.md`
4. **Learn as You Build**: Reference specific sections as needed for your project

### For the Experienced Developer
1. **Assessment First**: Take the `quizzes/final-assessment.md` to identify knowledge gaps
2. **Targeted Learning**: Focus on sections where you need reinforcement
3. **Contribute**: Share your expertise by improving content or adding new examples
