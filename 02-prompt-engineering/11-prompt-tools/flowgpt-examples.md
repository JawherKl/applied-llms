**Website:** [https://flowgpt.com](https://flowgpt.com)

## üéØ What is FlowGPT?

FlowGPT is a interactive community platform where users share, discuss, and **directly run** prompts within the browser. It's more focused on text-based LLMs and complex conversational agents than PromptHero.

Key features include a built-in chat interface to test prompts, upvotes/downvotes to gauge quality, and comments for discussion.

## üîç How to Use It for Learning

1.  **Browse by Category:** Explore categories like "Developer," "Marketing," "Education," or "Fun."
2.  **Run Prompts In-App:** Click the "Try on ChatGPT" button to see the prompt in action instantly. This is the fastest way to see the input-output relationship.
3.  **Read the Comments:** Often, users will share variations, improvements, or tips in the comments section.
4.  **See the "Prompt Chain":** Many prompts on FlowGPT are designed for multi-turn conversations. Examine how the initial prompt sets up the context for future interactions.

## üí° Practical Examples to Try on FlowGPT

1.  **The "AutoGPT" Clone**
    *   **Search for:** `AutoGPT` or `AI Agent`
    *   **What it does:** These prompts attempt to simulate a semi-autonomous AI agent that can break down a high-level goal into subtasks.
    *   **Learning Goal:** This is a masterclass in prompt chaining and role-playing. See how the prompt establishes rules, a persona, and a step-by-step process for the AI to follow.

2.  **The "Expert" Interviewer**
    *   **Search for:** `Interview with a [Historical Figure]` or `Expert Interview`
    *   **What it does:** These prompts make the AI embody a character and conduct a realistic interview with the user.
    *   **Learning Goal:** Analyze how the prompt creates a consistent persona and sets boundaries for the interaction.

3.  **Code Review Assistant**
    *   **Browse the "Developer" category.**
    *   **What it does:** Prompts that ask the AI to act as a senior developer and review pasted code for errors, style, and security.
    *   **Learning Goal:** See how specific constraints are added (e.g., "Use the Google style guide", "Suggest fixes").

## üß† Exercise: Remix a Popular Prompt

1.  Find a popular prompt on FlowGPT, like a **"Creative Writing Assistant."**
2.  Run it as-is to see the output.
3.  Now, click "Continue Chat" and try to **break the character**. Ask it questions that are outside its defined role. Observe how a well-crafted prompt will stick to its instructions, while a weaker one might break character.
4.  Based on what you learned, go back and try to improve the initial prompt to make the character more robust against your "jailbreaking" attempts.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaway

FlowGPT is best for experiencing **interactive, multi-turn prompts**. It shows you how to design a prompt that governs not just a single response, but an entire conversation with a specific goal and personality.
