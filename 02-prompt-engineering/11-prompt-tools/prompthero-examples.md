**Website:** [https://prompthero.com](https://prompthero.com)

## üéØ What is PromptHero?

PromptHero is a massive search engine for AI art and LLM prompts. It's primarily known for image generation prompts (Midjourney, DALL-E), but it's also an incredible resource for finding inspiration and proven templates for text-based LLMs like ChatGPT.

Think of it as a "GitHub for prompts" where you can see what others have created and what works.

## üîç How to Use It for Text Prompts

1.  **Go to the website** and use the search bar.
2.  **Filter by AI Model.** While image models are default, you can search for "ChatGPT" or "GPT-4" to find text prompts.
3.  **Browse Popular Prompts.** See what's trending to understand what makes a prompt effective.
4.  **Analyze the Structure.** Click on a prompt to see its full text. Don't just copy it; reverse-engineer it. Why is it structured that way? What role, context, and format does it use?

## üß† Exercise: Reverse-Engineer a Prompt

1.  Find a prompt on PromptHero that generates a **"Product Description."**
2.  Copy the prompt into a document.
3.  Break it down using the **RTF Framework**:
    *   **Role:** What role is the AI playing? (e.g., "Senior Marketing Copywriter")
    *   **Task:** What is the core instruction? (e.g., "Generate a description for a new product")
    *   **Format:** What specific format is requested? (e.g., "3 paragraphs, highlight key features with bullet points")
4.  Now, modify the prompt to describe a completely different product (e.g., from a "smartwatch" to "a subscription box for gardeners"). See if the structure still holds up.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaway

PromptHero is not for copying; it's for **learning patterns**. The best use is to find a category of prompt you need, analyze the top 3-5 examples to identify common elements, and then synthesize your own, better prompt based on those patterns.
