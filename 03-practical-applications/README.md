# Part 3: Practical Applications

Welcome to the part where theory meets code! This section is all about **doing**. You'll move from understanding how LLMs work to actually integrating them into applications using APIs and building your first projects.

> **🎯 Goal for this Section:** To transition from a theoretical understanding of LLMs to being able to build functional, API-driven applications that solve real problems.

## 📚 What We'll Cover (Days 17-18+)

This section focuses on the practical implementation of LLMs:

1.  **Learn LLM APIs** - How to interact with various LLM providers programmatically.
2.  **Build a Simple App** - Create your first LLM-powered application from scratch.

## 🗺️ How to Navigate This Folder

This section is heavily focused on hands-on coding. The recommended path is to learn the API basics and then immediately apply them.

| File/Directory | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`17-llm-apis/`](./17-llm-apis/) | **Learn LLM APIs** | Guides for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere APIs with code examples. |
| [`18-simple-apps/`](./18-simple-apps/) | **Build Simple Apps** | Starter code and tutorials for building chatbots, assistants, and other demos. |
| [`13-use-cases/`](./13-use-cases/) | **Use Case Explorations** | Deep dives into practical applications like summarization, translation, and coding. |
| [`14-prompt-refinement.md`](./14-prompt-refinement.md) | **Prompt Refinement** | Techniques for iteratively improving your prompts for better results. |
| [`15-model-limitations.md`](./15-model-limitations.md) | **Model Limitations** | Understanding where and why models fail. |
| [`16-response-analysis.md`](./16-response-analysis.md) | **Response Analysis** | How to critically evaluate and compare LLM outputs. |

## 🛠️ Your Development Setup

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1.  **Python 3.10+** installed on your machine
2.  A code editor like **VS Code** with Python extension
3.  **API Keys** for at least one LLM provider:
    - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
    - [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
    - [Cohere API Key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)
4.  A virtual environment created and activated:
    ```bash
    python -m venv llm-env
    source llm-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: llm-env\Scripts\activate
    pip install openai anthropic cohere python-dotenv
    ```

## 🧪 Mindset for Success

*   **Start Small:** Begin with single API calls before building complex applications.
*   **Embrace Errors:** API errors, quota limits, and unexpected outputs are all learning opportunities.
*   **Read the Documentation:** Each API has its own nuances and capabilities. The official docs are your best friend.
*   **Secure Your Keys:** Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables (`.env` files).
*   **Think About Cost:** Be mindful of token usage, especially when experimenting with larger models.

## ✅ What You'll Build

By the end of this section, you should have:

- [ ] Made your first successful API call to an LLM provider
- [ ] Built a simple command-line chatbot
- [ ] Created a basic web interface for an LLM application
- [ ] Experimented with different models and parameters
- [ ] Understand how to handle API responses and errors

- **Provides Foundation For:** Part 4 (Advanced Topics like RAG and Agents), Part 5 (Build Projects)

## 🚨 Important Note on API Costs

While many providers offer free tiers, API usage can incur costs. Always:
- Monitor your usage in the provider's dashboard
- Set spending limits if available
- Start with smaller, cheaper models
- Use local models with Ollama for extensive experimentation
